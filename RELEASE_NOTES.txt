OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This KBase service provides an API for interacting with the KBase Objects Workspaces
(KOWs). KOWs provide an online location where objects generated by various KBase analyses
can be stored, accessed remotely, and shared. Once stored in a KOW, an objects is 
accessible to all KBase services for any authenticated user who has permission to view the
KOW. For example, a user may build a model using command line scripts on their computer.
Then they may run flux balance analysis on the model in IRIS. Finally, they may go to GLAM
and view the model and FBA results. Because objects are stored in a KOW, they can be 
accessed in all three environments. KOWs also provide a convenient means of sharing whole
datasets and workflows with users. A KOW could be considered supplementary material for a
paper. Finally, the KOWs maintain complete history of all objects, enabling a user to
review the revisions made to an object over time.
